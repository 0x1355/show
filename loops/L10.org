Henry works fulltime as a data analyst in a tech company. He is earning a decent
salary and understands the basic concepts in data and software.

Alongside his day job, Henry has a small crypto portfolio and is considering to
find a job in web3. He spend about an hour a day reading information about
crypto and web3.

Henry put down his phone and yawned. He looks at the clock. two hours passed since
he started reading about crypto and web3. But it seems that the more he reads,
the less he understands.

He signed. Why? Just this morning at work, it took him less than two hours to
grasp the basics of D3.js. By the end of the afternoon he already made a
prototype chart with it. But this crypto thing is just too confusing. 


** DONE What don't they like about the situation?

He feels that he can't find a time-effective approach to gather reliable
information about how something actually works in crypto. He has tried the
following but none satisfies him:

|--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| Info source        | Not happy about                                          |
|--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| Crypto twitter     | Too many memes and shitposts. High noise-to-signal ratio |
| Crypto YouTube     | Too high-level, ambiguous, and generic                   |
| Project whitepaper | Too abstrat or too much math                             |
| Project github     | Can't read code                                          |
| Project Discord    | Even higher noise-to-signal ratio                        |
|--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|


** DONE What do they want instead?

Henry wants to have a source where he can get crypto related information that:
1. Explains things simply and intuitively
2. Answers his specific questions
3. Helps him make meaningful decisions
4. Doesn't require reading code or math formulas


** DONE To get that, what price would they need to pay?
