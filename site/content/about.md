## What is this site about?
When I first dove into smart contracts, I was drowning in an ocean of technical terms, futuristic visions, and colorful personalities. It was tough to make sense of it all.  I was looking for something that explains what smart contracts are and how they work. I wanted information that is simple and clear, not overly abstract or ignoring how things actually work. 

I couldn't find anything back then. And I still hadn't find anything in early 2022, by the time I start Money Data Reality. 

Money Data Reality is the site I wish existed when I started seriously learning about smart contracts.

## Who are you and why should I trust you?
I am Hao - pronounced "how". I also go by the name of 0x1355 on Twitter. Before I dedicated full-time to crypto investing and writing about smart contracts, I had more than 10 years of experience in product management, marketing, and data science. 

When it comes to smart contracts and crypto in general, it is best not to blindly trust anyone. I learned this the hard way. Now when I decide whether I can trust someone or some information source, I ask myself two questions:

### Is there any conflict of interests?
Pump and dump scheme is a prime example of this. A crypto influenecer advocates for certain project. You buy some tokens. Then the influencer sells his tokens at a profit. And your tokens are worth a lot less. It was a zero-sum game with high conflict of interest.

Since I invest in crypto myself, I do the following to eliminate conflict of interest between you and me as much as possible:

1. I will not give any recommendation or suggestion on what to invest or not. 
2. When talking about a specific smart contract, I will compare it to similar smart contracts and point out pros and cons.
3. If I hold tokens for a smart contract I write about, I will disclose it.

### What does the data say?
Fundamentally, smart contracts are just pieces of software that change data on some blockchains. The data is the source of truth, openly accessible to everyone. If someone says many nice things about a smart contract project, but couldn't tell you how it is actually used with data, you should be cautious. 

When it comes to Money Data Reality, I will back all key points in my posts with data. 

## Don't be a stranger
It takes quite some time and energy to write about smart contracts this way. So if you like what you read, drop me an email at 0x1355 //AT// gmail //DOT// com. Let me know what you like, and what else you would like to learn about smart contracts. This will help me wirte better and more relevant content in the future.
