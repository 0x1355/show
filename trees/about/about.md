## Should I spend more time reading MDR?
Hello there, welcome to Money Data Reality. We go through a huge amount of data to find out how smart contracts are actually used in the real world. 

You are likely to find useful insight in our posts if you are in one of the following groups of people:
1. People who are interested to learn about smart contracts
2. People who are already using smart contracts
3. People who build smart contracts

## What does "actually used" mean?
## What kind of data? Is it reliable?
## Why should I trust you?
## Okay, what should I read next?
